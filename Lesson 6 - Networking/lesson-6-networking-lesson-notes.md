# Lesson 6 - Networking

The ping command sends a special network packet called an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to a specified host. Most network devices receiving this packet will reply to it, allowing the network connection to be verified. Although, it's possible to configure most network devices (including Linux hosts) to ignore these packets.

The traceroute program lists all the "hops" network traffic takes to get from the local system to a specified host.
