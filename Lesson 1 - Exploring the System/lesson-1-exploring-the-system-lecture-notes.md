Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 19, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. 
The Linux kernel is a free, open-source, monolithic, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is provided under the GNU GPL v2 only but contains files under other compatible licenses.

Linux is deployed on a wide variety of computer systems, such as embedded devices, mobile devices (including its use in the Android OS), personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
