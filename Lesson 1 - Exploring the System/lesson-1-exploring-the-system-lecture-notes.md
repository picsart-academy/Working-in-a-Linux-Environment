# Lesson 1. Exploring the System (lesson notes)
Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 19, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. 

The Linux kernel is a free, open-source, monolithic, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It is provided under the GNU GPL v2 only but contains files under other compatible licenses.

The Linux kernel repository: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
General link: https://kernel.org/

The kernel is written in C, Rust, and the assembly languages.

Linux is deployed on a wide variety of computer systems, such as embedded devices, mobile devices (including its use in the Android OS), personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers. The list includes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, video game consoles, televisions, automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota), and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule and the Perseverance rover). 

The Linux development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML), http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html 

Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. 

Over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operatings systems are Linux.
